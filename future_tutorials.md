# Future Tutorial Ideas

## Cleaning up datasets in more detail
* Subsetting using []
* Renaming rows and columns
* Deadling with spaces in rows (e.g. when you think it's a NA, but it's not blank, cause there is a space)
* Getting rid of NAs

## Dealing with Large Datasets
* Import methods
  * data.table
  * fread
  * read_
* Data Manipulation
  * Being parsimonious
  * Taking advantage of R object orientated environment
  * Pipes revisit
* .RData objects
* Saving a workspace

## Time Series Data (John has dibs - Will hopefully write up over the summer)
* lubridate
* zoo
* xts
* quantmod
* plotting using ggplot2

## Structural Equation Modelling

## Intro to Python (Need someone else to run this, Geology/geography/geomorphology folk use it a lot, talk to Simon Mudd)
	* Boris Gailleton (Geomorphology Masters student starting PhD Sept 2017)

## Coding etiquette and reproducible research (Gergana has dibs)
* Formatting graphs and tables for professional publication
* packrat - for package management in a project
* Lots of links to other tutorials
 * github tut.
 * RMarkdown tut.

## Making an R package with useful functions
* theme_clean

## General RStudio IDE Customisation
* Addins
* Syntax highlighting
* Autocomplete

## Scenario challenge
* Test student's abilities by drawing on ideas from multiple tutorials
* In the context of taking an experiment through data exploration, analysis, presentation, publishing
* Example:
  * Clean and get ready for analysis (Tut.2)
  * Create explanatory figures of relationships between variables (Tut.4)
  * Test a hypothesis using general linear models (Tut.5)
  * Test another hypothesis using a heirarchical model (Tut.7)
  * Create an Rmarkdown script of their work (Tut.6)
  * Upload the whole lot to a github repo (Tut.3)
  
# Website developments
* Expandable dropdown boxes for parts of tutorials, to streamline tutorial page
* Common problems page (could this be an interactive flowchart?)
* Add "If you want to keep up with Coding Club updates, follow us on Twitter" or something to the footer of each tut
* Add "To receive updates on the workshops we are organising, please join our mailing list" to the footer of each tut
* Sprinkle links between tuts - e.g. when we use `dplyr`, link to Sandra's tut for more info
* Change duplicate hexagon icons, navigating tutorials at a glance is difficult at the moment

# Future CC developments
* Email Richard Essery mid-April regarding Numeracy course & linking with Coding Club
* Build links with Python people, hold a Python session
* Find someone to teach a Java session
* Collaborate more with Drummond people - Geo taster sessions

# Promotion
* In Sem 1, put up posters around KB, Central and Drummond
* Speak at the info sessions for 1st year EES, the info session for 4th year EES
* Email lecturers to ask them to tell students about Coding Club, esp in their meetings with tutees
* Email EVERYONE to tell them about CC and ask them to join our mailing list if they want
