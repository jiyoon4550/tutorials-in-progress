# Future Tutorial Ideas

## Data vis 3 - animated graphs - Gergana

## Visualising movement, maps with lines connecting dots - Gergana
## Interactive maps using leaflet - Gergana

## Cleaning up datasets in more detail - Gergana
* Subsetting using []
* Renaming rows and columns
* Deadling with spaces in rows (e.g. when you think it's a NA, but it's not blank, cause there is a space)
* Getting rid of NAs
* Reordering levels of a categorical variable
* Re-ordering graphs based on e.g. ascending, descending order of a variable

## Using the vegan package for similarity & composition analysis - Gergana
* Turning a species list into a presence/absence matrix
* Calculating Simpson's, Shannon, Jaccard, Sorensen and Chao indices
* PCA & ordination analyses

## Some people have suggested a workshop specifically on base R tricks
* Subsetting using [] - Note this is currently in "Cleaning up datasets in more detail - Gergana"
* for loops, if/ifelse, functions
* lists

# Build on troubleshooting tutorial
* Building a Minimal Working Example to ask a question on Stackoverflow
* Reading R help files
* Link to the /links page on the website

## Power analysis - Gergana

## Reproducible research - Gergana
* Building on Markdown and etiquette tutorial
* Formatting graphs and tables for professional publication
* packrat - for package management in a project
* roxygen2 for making a personalised R package
* Storing your data in a package
  
## Analysing qualitative survey data - John
* likert scales
* bar graphing
* chi^2
* poisson regression
* logistic regression

## Dealing with Large Datasets - John
* Import methods
  * data.table
  * fread
  * read_
* Data Manipulation
  * Being parsimonious
  * Taking advantage of R object orientated environment
  * Pipes revisit
* .RData objects
* Saving a workspace

## Structural Equation Modelling - John

## General RStudio IDE Customisation
* Addins
* Syntax highlighting
* Autocomplete

## Scenario challenge
* Test student's abilities by drawing on ideas from multiple tutorials
* In the context of taking an experiment through data exploration, analysis, presentation, publishing
* Example:
  * Clean and get ready for analysis (Tut.2)
  * Create explanatory figures of relationships between variables (Tut.4)
  * Test a hypothesis using general linear models (Tut.5)
  * Test another hypothesis using a heirarchical model (Tut.7)
  * Create an Rmarkdown script of their work (Tut.6)
  * Upload the whole lot to a github repo (Tut.3) 

## For Sept and onwards, Gergana will draft an email asking people if they want to write a tutorial for the website and run a CC workshop in their institution, we can then all send that to the academics we know. And also check who is coming for seminars, maybe they have stats knowledge to share.

# Website developments
* Expandable dropdown boxes for parts of tutorials, to streamline tutorial page
* Common problems page (could this be an interactive flowchart?)

# Future CC developments
* Build links with Python people, hold a Python session - joana.ferreira@sruc.ac.uk 
	* Boris Gailleton (Geomorphology Masters student starting PhD Sept 2017)
* Find someone to teach a Java session - evancornforth@gmail.com
* Collaborate more with Drummond people - Geo taster sessions - Owen.Macdonald@ed.ac.uk 

# Promotion
* In Sem 1, put up posters around KB, Central and Drummond - Gergana
* International posters - Gergana, done! 
* Speak at the info sessions for 1st year EES, the info session for 4th year EES
* Email lecturers to ask them to tell students about Coding Club, esp in their meetings with tutees
* Email EVERYONE to tell them about CC and ask them to join our mailing list if they want

# Future years
* Expanding Coding Club to Linguistics and Psychology?
	* Books
		* Lewandowska - Linguistics
		* Andy Field - Psychology
	* Market
		* Hons diss students - Feb/Mar
		* MSc diss students - May-July
		* Both get a short intro but only a minority are quantitative minded so nothing indepth given
		* They can consult Tom Booth (Psy lecturer) but normally this lecturer isn't available when they really need it
